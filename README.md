# Restaurant Manager App

## Introduction

This is a solo developed project, which aims to solve some real life challenges and needs trough its implementation that may occur in restaurants of different sizes. 
As the project evolse so will it rescive a wider set of features for solving different business problems, for different stakeholders( for example : customers,managers,owners etc.).
The development will follow agile (iterative) methodology, with gitflow workflow as main branching strategy. Some feature branches might remain fruitless, but the main code base is intended to be deployable at all times.

## CORE FEATURES

This section will be continously updated as new features are implemented.
